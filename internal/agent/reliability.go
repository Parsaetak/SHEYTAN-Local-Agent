// reliability.go — v1.1.5Z Phase 6: the agent reliability core.
//
// SHEYTAN's strategic product target is that a small local model plus
// SHEYTAN accomplishes work that normally requires a substantially larger
// model or a cloud agent. The three components in this file are what make
// that credible for the EXECUTION loop:
//
//  1. FailureClassification — every tool failure is diagnosed into an
//     explicit category, and the recovery hint fed back to the model is
//     chosen from the CATEGORY, not from the raw error text. A wrong
//     path gets a filesystem hint; a refused connection gets a network
//     hint; a rejected context window gets a context hint. The model
//     re-plans against the diagnosis instead of retrying blind.
//
//  2. LoopGuard — detects repetitive agent behaviour: the same tool
//     called with the same arguments, the same failure recurring with
//     no measurable progress. Repetition is answered with an explicit
//     strategy-change instruction, and beyond a bound the run is
//     terminated honestly instead of burning iterations.
//
//  3. RunBudget — bounded attempts, tool calls, repair cycles and wall
//     clock. The orchestrator already bounds iterations; this adds the
//     finer-grained counters so a single runaway loop inside one
//     iteration cannot consume the machine.
//
// The design keeps the existing resource posture: nothing here retries
// silently, nothing grows without a bound, and every intervention is
// visible as an Activity so the timeline stays honest.
